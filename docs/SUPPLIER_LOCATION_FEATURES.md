## üèÜ Best Price Finder

### The Smart Feature

```
GET /best-price/{item_name}?location_id={location_id}
```

Finds the best price for an item, considering:
- Item price from each supplier
- Shipping cost to the location (if location_id provided)
- Supplier availability and rating
- **Total cost** = unit_price + shipping_cost

**Without Location:**
```json
GET /best-price/Office%20Chair

{
  "item_name": "Office Chair",
  "supplier_id": 3,
  "supplier_name": "Furniture Wholesalers",
  "unit_price": 149.99,
  "rating": 4,
  "lead_time_days": 5,
  "minimum_order_quantity": 1
}
```

**With Location:**
```json
GET /best-price/Office%20Chair?location_id=2

{
  "item_name": "Office Chair",
  "supplier_id": 5,
  "supplier_name": "Local Furniture Co",
  "unit_price": 159.99,
  "shipping_cost": 5.00,
  "total_cost": 164.99,
  "distance_km": 12.5,
  "estimated_delivery_days": 1,
  "rating": 5,
  "lead_time_days": 3,
  "minimum_order_quantity": 1
}
```

### Why It's Powerful

**Scenario:** You need to order "Office Chair" to "Main Warehouse"

**Option 1:**
- Supplier A: $149.99 + $50 shipping = **$199.99**
- Distance: 500 km
- Delivery: 7 days

**Option 2:**
- Supplier B: $159.99 + $5 shipping = **$164.99** ‚úì BEST
- Distance: 12 km
- Delivery: 1 day

The API automatically finds **Option 2** because it considers total cost!

## üí° Practical Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Supplier Price Comparison

```python
# Get all suppliers for "Laptop Dell XPS"
GET /item-suppliers/Laptop%20Dell%20XPS

# Response shows 3 suppliers:
# 1. TechDist: $1299.99 (Min order: 5)
# 2. GlobalElec: $1350.00 (Min order: 1)
# 3. BulkTech: $1199.99 (Min order: 50)

# For small order (1 unit): Choose GlobalElec
# For bulk order (50+ units): Choose BulkTech (save $100/unit!)
```

### Example 2: Location-Based Ordering

```python
# Warehouse in New York needs "Office Supplies"
GET /location-suppliers/2  # New York warehouse ID

# Shows suppliers sorted by distance:
# 1. Local Office Supply (15 km, $10 shipping, 1 day)
# 2. Regional Wholesaler (100 km, $35 shipping, 2 days)
# 3. National Distributor (800 km, $75 shipping, 5 days)

# For urgent orders: Use #1 (faster, cheaper shipping)
# For bulk orders: Use #3 (better unit prices despite shipping)
```

### Example 3: Best Price with Shipping

```python
# Find best total price for "Printer" to deliver to Boston warehouse
GET /best-price/Printer?location_id=5

# API calculates:
# Supplier A: $299 + $50 = $349
# Supplier B: $320 + $10 = $330 ‚úì Best total
# Supplier C: $280 + $80 = $360

# Returns Supplier B even though not cheapest unit price
```
