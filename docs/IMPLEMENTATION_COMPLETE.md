## 📦 Features Implemented

### 1. **SHA-256 Password Hashing** ✅
- All user passwords stored as SHA-256 hashes
- Automatic migration for existing plaintext passwords
- Default admin (username: `admin`, password: `1234`) uses SHA-256

**Files Modified:**
- `services/user_service.py` - Password hashing logic
- `api.py` - Auto-update existing passwords

**Test Coverage:** ✅ Complete

---

### 2. **Change Password Functionality** ✅
- Users can change their own password
- Requires old password verification
- New password automatically hashed

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /users/me/change-password`

**Test Coverage:** ✅ Complete

---

### 3. **Custom Fields for Items** ✅
- Store unlimited custom metadata per item
- JSON-based storage in database
- Fully searchable and exportable

**Example:**
```json
{
  "item_name": "Laptop",
  "custom_fields": {
    "brand": "Dell",
    "model": "XPS 15",
    "serial_number": "ABC123",
    "warranty_expires": "2025-12-31"
  }
}
```

**Test Coverage:** ✅ Complete

---

### 4. **Advanced Search** ✅
- Three search modes: `starts_with`, `contains`, `exact`
- Intelligent result sorting (exact → starts_with → contains)

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /inventory/search`

**Test Coverage:** ✅ Complete

---

### 5. **CSV Export** ✅
- Export entire inventory or specific groups
- Timestamped filenames

### 7. **Enhanced Reporting** ✅
- Comprehensive inventory statistics
- Group-wise breakdown
- Automatic low stock detection
- Optional group filtering

**API Endpoint:**
- `GET /reports/inventory?groups=Electronics`

---

### 8. **Automated Backup System** ✅
- Creates timestamped database backups
- Format: `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db`
- Admin-only feature

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /backup`

**Test Coverage:** ✅ Complete

---

### 9. **Role-Based Access Control** ✅
Enhanced three-tier permission system:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Full access: users, backup, export, all CRUD operations |
| **Editor** | Add/edit items, prices, groups (no user management) |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to inventory and reports |

**Implementation:**
- FastAPI dependency injection
- Enforced at API endpoint level
- Consistent across all routes

**Test Coverage:** ✅ Integrated in all tests

### Documentation:
- `NEW_FEATURES.md` - Complete feature documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Testing:
- `test_new_features.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- All 7 test categories passing

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
python api.py
```

The API will:
- Initialize database
- Create admin user with SHA-256 hashed password
- Start server on http://127.0.0.1:8001

### 2. Login
```
Username: admin
Password: 1234
```

### 3. Test Features
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python test_new_features.py

# Or test individual features via API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/token \
  -d "username=admin&password=1234"
```

---

## 🔄 Database

**No schema changes required!** All features work with existing database:

- `users` table - Stores SHA-256 hashed passwords
- `items` table - Includes `custom_fields` JSON column
- `history` table - Tracks all actions
- `prices` table - Price tracking
- `groups` table - Group management

**Automatic Migration:**
- API automatically updates plaintext passwords to SHA-256 on startup
- No manual intervention needed
