---

## üß™ STEP 3: Test Authentication

Open a **new terminal** (keep the backend running) and test login:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/token" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ^
  -d "username=admin&password=1234"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

‚úÖ **Verification**: You should receive an access token

**üí° Save the token** - you'll need it for the next steps!

---

## üß™ STEP 4: Test Basic Endpoints

**Set your token** (replace YOUR_TOKEN with the actual token from Step 3):

**For Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

  },
  ...
]
```

‚úÖ **Verification**: Should show multiple locations with shipping info

### Test 6.2: Get Suppliers That Deliver to a Location
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8001/location-suppliers/1" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer %TOKEN%"
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"supplier_id\":2,\"item_name\":\"Laptop Dell XPS 15\",\"unit_price\":1199.99,\"minimum_order_quantity\":1,\"lead_time_days\":7,\"supplier_sku\":\"SKU-2-LAPTO\"}"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Supplier product added successfully",
  "id": 42
}
```

‚úÖ **Verification**: Should return success with new ID

### Test 7.2: Verify the New Product Was Added
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8001/item-suppliers/Laptop Dell XPS 15" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer %TOKEN%"
```

‚úÖ **Verification**: Should now show **3 suppliers** instead of 2, with supplier #2 having price $1199.99

### Test 7.3: Add a New Supplier-Location Link
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/supplier-locations" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer %TOKEN%" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"supplier_id\":2,\"location_id\":1,\"distance_km\":50.0,\"shipping_cost\":10.0,\"estimated_delivery_days\":1}"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Supplier location added successfully",
  "id": 15
}
```

‚úÖ **Verification**: Should return success

### Test 7.4: Verify Best Price Changed!
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8001/best-price/Laptop Dell XPS 15?location_id=1" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer %TOKEN%"
```

‚úÖ **Expected**: Should now show supplier #2 with total cost $1209.99 ($1199.99 + $10 shipping)

---

## üåê STEP 8: Test Using Browser (API Documentation)

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs
```

You should see **Swagger UI** with all API endpoints.

### Test in Browser:

1. **Click "Authorize"** button at the top right
2. **Login**:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `1234`
3. **Try the new endpoints**:
   - Scroll down to "Supplier-Products" section
   - Click on `GET /supplier-products/{supplier_id}`
   - Click "Try it out"
   - Enter supplier_id: `1`
   - Click "Execute"
   - ‚úÖ Should see products list

4. **Try best price finder**:
   - Find `GET /best-price/{item_name}`
   - Click "Try it out"
   - item_name: `Laptop Dell XPS 15`
   - location_id: `1`
   - Click "Execute"
   - ‚úÖ Should see best price with shipping

---

## üöÄ STEP 9: Start Frontend (Optional)

If you want to test the full UI:

**Open a third terminal** and run:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Access**: http://localhost:3000

**Login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `1234`

**Test Global Search:**
- Press **Ctrl+K** (or Cmd+K on Mac)
- Type any item name
- ‚úÖ Should see search results

---

## üìä STEP 10: Run Automated Test Suite

To verify everything at once:

```bash
python tests/test_complete_system.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================

## üéØ What to Look For (Success Criteria)

### ‚úÖ Multi-Supplier Products Working:
- One product can have multiple suppliers
- Each supplier has different prices
- Can compare all suppliers for any item
- Results sorted by price

### ‚úÖ Supplier-Location Working:
- Each supplier linked to multiple locations
- Distance and shipping cost tracked
- Can find all suppliers for a location
- Can find all locations for a supplier

### ‚úÖ Best Price Finder Working:
- **Without location**: Returns cheapest unit price
- **With location**: Returns cheapest **total** price (unit + shipping)
- Considers shipping costs in calculation
- May return different supplier when location is specified

### ‚úÖ Smart Feature Working:
The key feature to test is this scenario:
- Supplier A: $100 item + $50 shipping = **$150 total**
- Supplier B: $120 item + $10 shipping = **$130 total**
- System should choose **Supplier B** (cheaper total even though item is more expensive)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Connection refused"
**Solution**: Make sure backend is running (`python api.py`)

### Problem: "Unauthorized"
**Solution**: Get a new token from Step 3

### Problem: "No data returned"
**Solution**: Regenerate database (`python generate_sample_data.py`)

### Problem: "Module not found"
**Solution**: Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Problem: Port 8001 already in use
**Solution**:
```bash
# Find and kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :8001
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```
