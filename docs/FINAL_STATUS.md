## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Connection Verification
**Created**: `tests/verify_connections.py`
- Automated connection testing
- Tests backend-database connection
- Tests backend API availability
- Tests frontend-backend API calls
- Provides detailed status report

### 2. ✅ Sample Data Generation Fixed
**Modified**: `generate_sample_data.py`
- Now **automatically deletes old database** before creating new one
- Eliminates need for manual database cleanup
- Ensures fresh start every time
- No more "UNIQUE constraint" errors

**How it works**:
```python
python generate_sample_data.py
```
This will:
1. Delete old `inventory.db`, `inventory.db-shm`, `inventory.db-wal`
2. Create fresh database with schema
3. Populate with sample data
4. No errors, no conflicts!

### 3. ✅ Removed Unnecessary Files
**Removed**: `populate_data.py`
- Was just a wrapper around generate_sample_data.py
- No longer needed
- Simplified workflow

### 4. ✅ Organization Completed
**Documentation moved to `/docs/`**:
- FRONTEND_FEATURES_ADDED.md
- QUICK_TEST.md
- START_TESTING.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md
- SUPPLIER_LOCATION_FEATURES.md
- FINAL_VERIFICATION.md
- SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md
- FINAL_STATUS.md (this file)

**Tests moved to `/tests/`**:
- verify_connections.py (NEW)
- test_complete_system.py
- test_supplier_location.py
- test_integration.py
- (and all other test files)
