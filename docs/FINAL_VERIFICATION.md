## 🎯 Key Features

### Multi-Supplier Product Pricing
**Problem Solved**: Track which suppliers offer which products at what prices

**How It Works**:
1. Link products to multiple suppliers
2. Each supplier-product relationship stores:
   - Unit price
   - Supplier SKU
   - Minimum order quantity
   - Lead time
   - Availability
3. Compare all suppliers for any item
4. Find cheapest supplier automatically

**Example Use Case**:
```
Product: "Office Chair"
Supplier A: $149.99 (Min order: 1)
Supplier B: $139.99 (Min order: 10)
Supplier C: $129.99 (Min order: 50)

Choose based on your order quantity!
```

---

### Supplier-Location Proximity
**Problem Solved**: Optimize ordering based on supplier proximity to your warehouses

**How It Works**:
1. Link suppliers to locations they can deliver to
2. Store for each link:
   - Distance in kilometers
   - Estimated delivery days
   - Shipping cost
   - Mark preferred suppliers
3. Find nearest suppliers to any location
4. Calculate total cost = item price + shipping

**Example Use Case**:
```
Need: "Laptop" delivered to New York Warehouse

Option 1: Supplier A
- Price: $1299
- Shipping: $50 (500km away)
- Total: $1349
- Delivery: 7 days

Option 2: Supplier B (BEST)
- Price: $1320
- Shipping: $10 (25km away)
- Total: $1330 ✓
- Delivery: 1 day ✓

System automatically finds Option 2!
```
