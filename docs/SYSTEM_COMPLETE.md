## 🎓 How It Works

### Scenario 1: Find Best Price for an Item
```bash
GET /best-price/Office Chair

Response:
{
  "item_name": "Office Chair",
  "supplier_id": 2,
  "supplier_name": "Office Depot Pro",
  "unit_price": 149.99,
  "supplier_sku": "SKU-2-OFFIC",
  "minimum_order_quantity": 5,
  "lead_time_days": 3
}
```

### Scenario 2: Find Best Price Including Shipping
```bash
GET /best-price/Office Chair?location_id=1

Response:
{
  "item_name": "Office Chair",
  "supplier_id": 3,
  "supplier_name": "Local Supplier",
  "unit_price": 159.99,
  "shipping_cost": 5.00,
  "total_cost": 164.99,  ← Cheaper than $149.99 + $50 shipping!
  "distance_km": 25.5,
  "estimated_delivery_days": 1
}
```

### Scenario 3: View Supplier Products
```bash
GET /supplier-products/1
