## üß™ STEP 4: Test the New Features

### Test A: See What Products a Supplier Offers

1. Scroll down to find **"GET /supplier-products/{supplier_id}"**
2. Click on it to expand
3. Click **"Try it out"** button
4. In the `supplier_id` field, enter: `1`
5. Click **"Execute"**

**‚úÖ You should see**: A list of products that supplier #1 offers, with prices, SKUs, minimum order quantities

---

### Test B: Compare All Suppliers for One Product

1. Find **"GET /item-suppliers/{item_name}"**
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. In the `item_name` field, enter: `Laptop Dell XPS 15`
4. Click **"Execute"**

**‚úÖ You should see**: Multiple suppliers offering the same item at different prices, sorted from cheapest to most expensive

---

### Test C: Find Best Price (No Location Specified)

1. Find **"GET /best-price/{item_name}"**
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. In the `item_name` field, enter: `Laptop Dell XPS 15`
4. Leave `location_id` **empty**
5. Click **"Execute"**

**‚úÖ You should see**: The cheapest supplier based only on unit price

**üí° Note the supplier ID** - you'll compare this in the next test!

---

### Test D: Find Best Price WITH Location (üî• THE KEY FEATURE!)

1. Same endpoint: **"GET /best-price/{item_name}"**
2. Click **"Try it out"** (if needed)
3. In the `item_name` field, enter: `Laptop Dell XPS 15`
4. In the `location_id` field, enter: `1`
5. Click **"Execute"**

**‚úÖ You should see**:
- Response includes **`shipping_cost`**
- Response includes **`total_cost`** (unit_price + shipping)
- The supplier **might be different** from Test C!
- Even if unit price is higher, total cost is lower because shipping is cheaper

**üéØ This is the smart feature!** The system finds the cheapest **delivered** price, not just the cheapest item price.

---

### Test E: See Where a Supplier Delivers

1. Find **"GET /supplier-locations/{supplier_id}"**
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. Enter `supplier_id`: `1`
4. Click **"Execute"**

**‚úÖ You should see**: All locations supplier #1 can deliver to, with:
- Distance in kilometers
- Shipping cost
- Estimated delivery days
- Whether it's a preferred supplier

---

### Test F: See All Suppliers for a Location

1. Find **"GET /location-suppliers/{location_id}"**
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. Enter `location_id`: `1`
4. Click **"Execute"**

**‚úÖ You should see**: All suppliers that can deliver to location #1, sorted by distance/shipping cost

---

## üéØ Understanding the Results

### Example Scenario:

**Without Location (Test C)**:
```json
{
  "item_name": "Laptop Dell XPS 15",
  "supplier_id": 2,
  "supplier_name": "Office Depot Pro",
  "unit_price": 1199.99
}
```

**With Location (Test D)**:
```json
{
  "item_name": "Laptop Dell XPS 15",
  "supplier_id": 1,
  "supplier_name": "TechWorld Solutions",
  "unit_price": 1249.99,
  "shipping_cost": 10.00,
  "total_cost": 1259.99,
  "distance_km": 50.5,
  "estimated_delivery_days": 1
}
```

**Why different?**
- Supplier #2 has cheaper unit price ($1199.99)
- BUT shipping to location #1 costs $100
- Total would be: $1299.99

- Supplier #1 has higher unit price ($1249.99)
- BUT shipping only costs $10 (closer to location)
- Total: $1259.99 ‚úÖ **CHEAPER!**

## üéì What Each Feature Does

### 1. Supplier-Products
- **Problem**: Need to compare prices across multiple suppliers
- **Solution**: Track which suppliers offer which products at what prices
- **Benefit**: Find best deals, compare minimum order quantities, track availability

### 2. Supplier-Locations
- **Problem**: Shipping costs vary based on distance
- **Solution**: Track supplier proximity to each location with shipping costs
- **Benefit**: Optimize total delivered cost, not just unit price

### 3. Best Price Finder
- **Without location**: Cheapest unit price
- **With location**: Cheapest **total** price (unit + shipping)
- **Smart**: May pick different supplier when location matters

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Test Adding New Data (Advanced)

1. Find **"POST /supplier-products"**
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. Edit the JSON to add a new supplier-product relationship
4. Click **"Execute"**
5. Then run Test B again to see the new supplier!

### Run Automated Tests

Open a **new terminal** (keep backend running) and run:
```bash
python tests/test_complete_system.py
```

Should see: **"ALL TESTS PASSED"**

### Start Frontend (Optional)

Open another terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 and login (admin/1234)
Press **Ctrl+K** for global search!
